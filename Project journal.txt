Project Journal (don´t forget timestamps!!!)

1. Initial ideas about project structure before and during coding
19/01/2026 - setup project on github and create prepare.sh for directory setup and input download
20/01/2026 - planning to use a modular structure with a main runnal-file and a seperate library for helper functions etc.
20/01/2026 - decided to use panda libray to create dataframes for easier data manipulation
20/01/2026 - get species id from names (species dataframe) and look for orthologous groups in the last column of members dataframe (inclusion/exclusion)

2. Design decisions and why you made them, including approaches you tried that didn't work out



3. Testing and bugs encountered (with exact error messages and line numbers), and how you solved them

--Bug 1--
Date: 20/01/2026
Error message: ValueError: Index orthologous_group_id invalid
Description: While creating dataframes from input files, i tried to set a specific column as index using df.set_index('column_name'), but encountered a KeyError.
Solution: The column names were defined after setting the index, so i rearranged the code to first set the column names and then set the index.



4. Approximate time spent on each part






Import Data contains:
Annotations: orthologous group id, functional group, function description
Members: orthologous group id, num of proteins in that group, num of species containing that group, list of protein ids, list of species ids containing that group
Taxid info: spedies id, species name, lineage info
Eggnog functional categories: functional category id, functional category description



Next step:
get name from id for nice output in 1_A.txt
