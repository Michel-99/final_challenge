Project Journal (don´t forget timestamps!!!)

1. Initial ideas about project structure before and during coding
19/01/2026 - setup project on github and create prepare.sh for directory setup and input download
20/01/2026 - planning to use a modular structure with a main runnal-file and a seperate library for helper functions etc.
20/01/2026 - decided to use panda libray to create dataframes for easier data manipulation
20/01/2026 - get species id from names (species dataframe) and look for orthologous groups in the last column of members dataframe (inclusion/exclusion)
?Part michel missing?
29/01/2026 - create function to get species name through species id input
29/01/2026 - CATCH UP - implement type hints and doctests for eggnog library functions; improve docstrings
04/02/2026 - start work on Question 2: lineage-specific gene loss analysis
04/02/2026 - initial idea: count how many species each orthologous group appears in
11/02/2026 - decided to calculate total species count dynamically from data instead of hardcoding
06/02/2026 - work on getting functional categories from identified genes
07/02/2026 - count occurence of functional categories, add matching category description and output sorted by number of occurences to .csv table
10/02/2026 - debugging code for q2 & q3
12/02/2026 - create comprehensive summary file (COMPLETE_SUMMARY.txt) combining all Q1-Q3 results
12/02/2026 - add error handling for column name variations (orthologous_group_id vs index)
12/02/2026 - ensure all result files are properly saved to results/ directory


2. Design decisions and why you made them, including approaches you tried that didn't work out

20/01/2026 decided to use pandas library for the following reasons:
- efficient handling of large-scale eggNOG datasets (10,000+ OGs, 300+ species)
- boolean masking simplifies complex multi-species filtering operations
- vectorized operations (apply, map) are faster than manual loops
- natural fit for tabular biological data (OG annotations, species membership)
- built-in CSV/TSV export for result reporting
- better code readability compared to nested loops and dictionaries

using set --> faster than list, O(1) vs O(n), it also allows one-liner insteasd of more loops, getting rid of dubplications

3. Testing and bugs encountered (with exact error messages and line numbers), and how you solved them

--Bug 1--
Date: 20/01/2026
Error message: ValueError: Index orthologous_group_id invalid
Description: While creating dataframes from input files, i tried to set a specific column as index using df.set_index('column_name'), but encountered a KeyError.
Solution: The column names were defined after setting the index, so i rearranged the code to first set the column names and then set the index.

-- Bug 2--
Date: 29/01/2026
Using columns as index removes them from the dataframe

---Bug 3 ---
Date: 07.02.2026 & 12.02.2026
Error: The result file either showed only one or nothing
Description: The results were only showing: 
Analysis:
Primates, Chicken, Fish vs Rodents
============================================================
Conserved in Primates+Chicken+Fish: 1
Lost in both Mouse and Rat: 0
Lost ONLY in Mouse: 0
Lost ONLY in Rat: 0
Solution:  Debugging section, the column name was checked, the finding of the species taxid column was adapted and the taxids were converted into integers.


4. Approximate time spent on each part






Import Data contains:
Annotations: orthologous group id, functional group, function description
Members: orthologous group id, num of proteins in that group, num of species containing that group, list of protein ids, list of species ids containing that group
Taxid info: spedies id, species name, lineage info
Eggnog functional categories: functional category id, functional category description
