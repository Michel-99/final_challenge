Project Journal (don´t forget timestamps!!!)


19/01/2026 - setup project on github and create prepare.sh for directory setup and input download,
    !LLM-usage: learn github with gemini canvas

20/01/2026 - planning to use a modular structure with a main runnal-file and a seperate library for helper functions etc.

20/01/2026 - decided to use panda libray to create dataframes for easier data manipulation
    !LLM-usage: discussed pros and cons of using pandas vs read/write csv 
        results:
        Advantages of pandas: easy manipulation of dataframes
        disatvantages: RAM-usage as pandas loads entire dataset into RAM --> in our case the datasets are not too big

20/01/2026 - get species id from names (species dataframe) and look for orthologous groups in the last column of members dataframe (inclusion/exclusion)
    --Bug 1--
    Date: 20/01/2026
    Error message: ValueError: Index orthologous_group_id invalid
    Description: While creating dataframes from input files, i tried to set a specific column as index using df.set_index('column_name'), but encountered a KeyError.
    Solution: The column names were defined after setting the index, so i rearranged the code to first set the column names and then set the index.

?Part michel missing?

29/01/2026 - create function to get species name through species id input

29/01/2026 - CATCH UP - implement type hints and doctests for eggnog library functions; improve docstrings
    -- Bug 2--
    Date: 29/01/2026
    Using columns as index removes them from the dataframe

06/02/2026 - work on getting functional categories from identified genes

07/02/2026 - count occurence of functional categories, add matching category description and output sorted by number of occurences to .csv table




1. Initial ideas about project structure before and during coding
2. Design decisions and why you made them, including approaches you tried that didn't work out
3. Testing and bugs encountered (with exact error messages and line numbers), and how you solved them
4. Approximate time spent on each part



Import Data contains:
Annotations: orthologous group id, functional group, function description
Members: orthologous group id, num of proteins in that group, num of species containing that group, list of protein ids, list of species ids containing that group
Taxid info: spedies id, species name, lineage info
Eggnog functional categories: functional category id, functional category description
